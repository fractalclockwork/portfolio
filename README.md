## 🌐 About

I build intelligent, resilient platforms at the intersection of embedded systems, high-performance computing, and scientific modeling. My work spans:

- Embedded Linux drivers and kernel integration (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN)
- Real-time sensor + video acquisition pipelines (GStreamer, V4L2, FFmpeg)
- AI/ML model deployment in constrained environments (PyTorch, CUDA)
- Scientific DevOps and reproducibility via CI/CD, Docker, and GitHub Actions
- HPC acceleration with SIMD (AVX2), OpenMP, MPI, and custom CUDA kernels

I specialize in projects that require low-level insight and high-level systems thinking.
